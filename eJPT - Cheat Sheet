Here some useful commands I have taken during the INE learning path to pass the eJPT.
A pentest engagement needs some methodology.
The INE learning path provide all the basics needed to pass succesfuly the certification exam.

NETWORK (all IPs are fake)
Check interfaces : 
# ip addr

#check host are up
nmap 192.50.20.0/24

#check more with ping scan nmap
nmap -sP 192.50.20.0/24

#check single host (basic scan + all ports)
nmap -p- blabla.fake.website

#OS detection
nmap -O blabla.fake.website

#Scan all ports + version + script scanning
nmap -p- -sC -sV blabla.fake.website

##agressive detection which enables OS detection (-O), version detection (-sV), script scanning (-sC), and traceroute (--traceroute) and few more probes
nmap -A blabla.fake.website

#scan to detect firelwall settings
nmap -sA blabla.fake.website

##for opened port 21 on range with wildcard (not closed, not filtered, not wrapped)
nmap -p21 -sV 192.168.0.* --open

#scan many hosts
nmap -p- 192.168.1.1,2,3,4,5,6
#or
nmap -p- 192.168.1.1-6

#check  with script example 
nmap -p27017 --script=mongodb-info target-2 | less
